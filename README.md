# Etch-A-Sketch

This is my version of a project from The Odin Project's curriculum. 

The task was to create a digital Etch-A-Sketch, using plain JavaScript to manipulate the DOM.

[Guidance](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project) given by The Odin Project was intentionally light, to encourage students to conduct independent research to discover possible methods to use.

To generate the sketching grid, I researched how to use CSS Flexbox and applied that method in conjunction with JavaScript.
